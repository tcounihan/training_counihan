## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Data Sources
read in the data
Clean and Reshape data
remove unnecessary columns
check column typing
reshape data
Join to Regions dataset

##Load libraries

```{r} 
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
```

##upload data - benefits to using read.csv and using links to data are that the data are reproducible in an archived form

```{r} 
catch_original <- read_csv("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1")
``` 

##Now clean the data by removing some unneeded columns can use Region:Chum you can also use -in front of variables that you want to remove

```{r}  
catch_data <- catch_original %>% 
  select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum)

head(catch_data)
```

##Now that we have the data we are interested in using, we should do a little quality check to see that it seems as expected. One nice way of doing this is the summary function.

```{r} 
summary(catch_data)
```

##Change Chinook from character to numeric variable

```{r} 
catch_clean <- catch_data %>% 
  mutate(Chinook = as.numeric(Chinook))
head(catch_clean)
```

## isolate

```{r} 
i <- which(is.na(catch_clean$Chinook))
i
```

It looks like there is only one problem row, lets have a look at it in the original data.

```{r}
catch_data[i,]
```

if else reads that if Chinook = "I" is true then assign value as 1, else value = original value of Chinook
second pipe converts Chinook into a number because of Chinook = "I" cause R to default to a character variable

```{r}
catch_clean <- catch_data %>% 
  mutate(Chinook = ifelse(Chinook == "I", 1, Chinook)) %>%
  mutate(Chinook = as.numeric(Chinook))

head(catch_clean)
```


The next issue is that the data are in a wide format and, we want the data in a tall format instead. pivot_longer() from the tidyr package helps us do just this conversion:

# catch_long = catch_clean then pivot_longer (cols keep Region and Year (ignore in longifying), names_to ~ column names are converted to row data and the values in the rows are associated with the names_to column)

```{r}
catch_long <- catch_clean %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(Region, Year), names_to = "species", values_to = "catch")

head(catch_long)
```

# to go from long to wide

```{r}
catch_wider <- catch_long %>% pivot_wider (names_from = "species", values_from = "catch")

head (catch_wider)
```



```{r}
catch_long <- catch_long %>% 
  rename(catch_thousands = catch)


head(catch_long)
```

# converts catch to catch_thousands

```{r}
catch_long <- catch_long %>% 
  mutate(catch = catch_thousands * 1000)

head(catch_long)
```

# removes catch_thousands column

```{r}
catch_long <- catch_long %>% 
  mutate(catch = catch_thousands * 1000) %>% 
  select(-catch_thousands)

head(catch_long)
```

# summarize catch by region

```{r}
mean_region <- catch_long %>% 
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise(catch_mean = mean(catch))

head(mean_region)
```

# summarize sample size by region 

# `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

```{r}
n_region <- catch_long %>% 
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarize(n = n())

head(n_region)
```

# filter by SSE region

```{r}
SSE_catch <- catch_long %>% 
  filter(Region == "SSE")

head(SSE_catch)
```

# ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) arrange sorts by mean catch

```{r}
mean_region <- catch_long %>% 
  group_by(Region) %>% 
  summarise(catch_mean = mean(catch)) %>% 
  arrange(catch_mean)

head(mean_region)
```

# load in new data can limit download to select columns

```{r}
region_defs <- read_csv("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.303.1") %>% 
    select(code, mgmtArea)

head(region_defs)
```

# left join that keeps all of what is in catch_long but adds information from region_defs

```{r}
catch_joined <- left_join(catch_long, region_defs, by = c("Region" = "code"))

head(catch_joined)
```


```{r}
region_defs <- region_defs %>% 
  rename(Region = code, Region_Name = mgmtArea)

catch_joined <- left_join(catch_long, region_defs, by = c("Region"))

head(catch_joined)
```


# split and unite ~ substr from SAS
```{r}
sites_df <- data.frame(site = c("HAW-101",
                                "HAW-103",

                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

dates_df %>% 
  unite(date, year, month, day, sep = "-")
